# Description
This application was created to keep your teams information readily accessible. By inputting your team members/employees into the terminal and classifying them into 3 groups (Managers, Engineers, and Interns) you can record their office number, their github repo, or their university that they studied at. Once the information is inputted the program will generate a html file that will have cards created for each employee.
